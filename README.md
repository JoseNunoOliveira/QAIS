WP1 - Calculating fault propagation in functional programs

This site contains the experimental part of paper "A study of risk-aware program transformation" by D.R. Murta, and J.N. Oliveira (SCP, to appear).

Please download and unzip file website.zip first and then move to the just created directory website.

For the Haskell part run

ghci -XNPlusKPatterns paper_haskell_matlab

and follow the examples in Part I of paper_haskell_matlab.pdf

For the MATLAB part, open MATLAB in the same directory, where all the executables can be found, and run Part II of paper_haskell_matlab.pdf

Please report comments, bugs etc to Daniel Murta (danielrpmurta@gmail.com) or Jose Oliveira (jno@di.uminho.pt).

WP2 - Faults which interfere with termination

(...dually: programs which shouldn't terminate and sometimes do so...) On-going work, requires sub-distributions.

WP3 - Calculating fault propagation in component-oriented software

Paper: J.N. Oliveira. Preparing Relational Algebra for "Just Good Enough" Hardware. In RAMiCS, volume 8428 of LNCS, pages 119-138 (DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-06251-8_8) Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, 2014. (Slides of the presentation.)

NB: In the experiments underlying this paper we are using a probabilistic extension of a monadic library written in Haskell for the component coalgebraic combinators of Barbosa's PhD thesis: see the MMM Libray.
